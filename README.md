## about

PirateGold is a utility program to manage movie-files. It allows the end-user to connect a hard drive to the computer running the program, and simply scan the drive for movie-files. The program will automatically strip redundant information in the filename (e.g. "1080p", "[dutch version]", etc) and query OMDB. Once a drive has been scanned, all the recognized movies are displayed in a neat table format. The custom search bar allows users to set up complex queries that really drill down on their movie genre (e.g. "imdbRating > 7.0 AND language contains 'French' AND imdbVotes > 5000 and metaScore > 75"). The entire collection can be exported to a number of formats, and aggregate statistics can be made.

## accuracy

The program was tested on roughly 2000 movie filenames. It correctly classified 93.7% of them. Some of these included foreign (e.g. Dutch titles) or titles consisting entirely of numbers.
